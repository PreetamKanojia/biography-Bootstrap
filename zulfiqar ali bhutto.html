                  <p><b>Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (Sindhi: ذوالفقار علي ڀٽو; Urdu: ذُوالفِقار علی بُھٹّو5 January 1928 – 4 April 1979), also widely known as Quaid-e-Awam which means People's Leader, and Shaheed Bhutto which means Martyr Bhutto, was a Pakistani barrister, statesman and politician who served as the ninth prime minister of Pakistan from 1973 to 1977, and prior to that was the fourth president of Pakistan from 1971 to 1973. Bhutto is an icon of leadership for his efforts to preserve and lead the nation after the Bangladesh Liberation War when Pakistan was humiliated internationally. His government drafted the Constitution of Pakistan in 1973, which is the current constitution of the country. He was also the founder of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and served as its chairman until his execution in 1979. Bhutto's execution till this day is widely recognised as a judicial murder ordered by then dictator General Zia-ul-Haq.</b></p>
